  <longdescription>
    This is a small project of mine demonstrating a single-core CPU rendering of
    a 3D space. It utilizes a C file to define objects like spheres and
    polygons. User can move around using keyboard to see how the world looks
    like from different points of view and angles. Also there is a possibility
    to change focal length and even make it negative. Please be aware that this
    program is a toy and it is not meant to be used for purposes other than
    educational or just for fun.
